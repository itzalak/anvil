# TODO

- make linux installation more manageable, it is to big with too many failure points
- Add tlp to installation <https://linrunner.de/tlp/installation/arch.html>
- Considerations on installation of the LTS version for arch
- consider backup tools
    - <https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift> - system backup
    - <https://github.com/linuxmint/mintbackup> - user data backup
