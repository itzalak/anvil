# Decorator

This is simple setup to change my environment color scheme,
mostly from dark to light and vice-versa.

Applications the scripts can update:

- Alacritty
- Bspwm
- Dunst
- Rofi (rasi theme)
- Xresources (urxvt, polybar)

There is a tight coupling between the color scheme files generated by the
decorator scripts and the system configuration files.
To an extent this is undesirable, needs further thought and improvement.

## To do

Update decorate scripts to identify a failed theme and fail fast.

Applications _NOT_ supported.

- wallpaper
- gtk
- qt
- vim/neovim
- firefox
- zathura

Improve python code to flatten colors.

Decouple output - moving it to cache directory

## Warning

This is far from optimal and it's a WIP.
It's a on going process that might change without notice.

## Usage examples

```shell
$ decorate_load_xcolors color0 '#010201'
```

```shell
$ decorate_flatten_json_colorscheme ~/path/to/nord.json
```

```shell
$ decorate_new_output_files new-nord
```

```shell
$ decorate_environment new-nord
```
