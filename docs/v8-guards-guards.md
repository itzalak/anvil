# TODO

Revision named after Sir Terry Pratchett Discworld book [Guards! Guards!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guards!_Guards!).

## Objective

I have to set up a new machine with very different settings and requirements.

The current setup exists in a uneasy balance between the limitations of the machines I use and a desire to avoid
duplication of configuration/code. Although the initialization is fast(ish), there is still a significant amount
of manual work in configurations that cannot be automated, also considering the differences in hardware and OS
there is a growing number of constraints that make both systems setup subpair in what they could achieve.

Linux is also growing and changing constantly and experimentation comes at a cost in stability and workflow
disruption, that hinders me personally and diminishes the effectiveness of this configuration.

For this new machine the expectation are different, from hardware to usability and that will reflect in the
refactoring happening for v8.

WARN: There is too many unknowns, probably I will create another repository to handle all the testing, and merge
it here at a later date.

## Goals and Ideas

- Setup hyprland and play around with it.
- also try to set it up PLUS xfce or gnome (light), I need very occasionally a "normal" OS, hyprland is very unstable.
    - Might cause some issues with xorg vs wayland
