# Gnome

Normal gnome is loaded with packages I usually do not need.

This configuration relies only on the packages I think I will need for now.
As time goes I might want to change it.

## Concerns

This configuration relies quite significantly in the `gnome-shell` and extensions.
General management of visual and behavior aspects depend on:

- gnome-shell
- gnome-shell-extensions
- gnome-tweaks
- extension-manager (AUR)

I have yet to figure out how to save configurations, or autoinstall, which is a problem for the goal of this repository.

## Ideas

* Moving from wm mutter to awesome or bspwm, however I have very little idea of how to achieve this.
* Bind keybindings between bspwm, gnome and macOS to improve muscle memory
