## Concerns

- Look into <https://gitlab.com/btrfs-assistant/btrfs-assistant>
- <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Snapper>

- AMD + NVIDIA
    - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceQymkVg50k>
- dGPU management
    - According to the wiki, open drivers for both apps should be enough
    - <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PRIME#Open-source_drivers>
    - both graphics run simultaneously but the dGPU has minimal resource consumption

## Open questions

- Can I configure btrfs 'partitions' after installation?
    - For snapshots I think yes, others still unclear

## IDEA

Configuration as  code for pycharm and IDEA

Intellij IDEA community useful plugins:

// TODO: Update

- .ignore
- Emmylua
- Gherkin
- GraphQL
- IdeaVim
- Makefile Language
- Python
- Rainbow Brackets Lite
- Terraform and HCL
